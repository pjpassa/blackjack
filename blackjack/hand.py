The Hand class will keep a collection of cards.  It will use the rules to
determine the value of that hand.  It will contain a boolean to keep track of
whether the hand is busted, and it will contain another boolean to keep track
of whether the hand is blackjack.  It will have a method that will be used to
add cards to the hand.
